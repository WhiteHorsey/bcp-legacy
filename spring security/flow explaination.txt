every things starts when the client request something from our server

the first thing that is executed is the JwtFilter = has the role to validate and check everything regarding the token or the JWT token provided
	1- internal check in the jwtfilter if we have the jwt token or NOT.
		a- if Token missing return 403 ( missing jwt ).
		b- if token exists -> extract(  username or email ) = subject
	2- start the validation process:
		a- the jwtfilter will call the userDetailsService to fetch user from db providing the subject ( username or email ).
			a-1- user does not exists  --> return 403 ( user does not exists ).
			a-2- if user exists --> validate the token based on the user
	3- the validation process itself:
		a- call JwtService that take a param the user itself + the token
			a-1- first scenario : the token is not valid. ( expired , token not for that user )  ---> send  403 ( invalid jwt token )
	4- update the security context holder and set this connected user that we fetch from the user deatils service.
		then set the filter chain that this user is now authenticated
		after that the security context holder will dispatch the request tothe dispatcher servlet then sent to the controller.

let say we have service-one ( 8081 ) and service-two ( 8082 )
and service-two scaled up to 10 instances  = 10 other ports that service-one needs to know.
	======> the process of automatically detecting devices and services on network

We have eureka clients and eureka server
A- the clients will register to the server ===> the server will know exactly the information where the service is running host ( IP ) + Port.
2- The microservice will talk to other microservices will baseically lookUP to the eureka server
This is how they can connect with each other

=====> the server knows all the clients running on each port and IP 


In the example

Customer 8080 will register to the eureka server
Fraud 8081,8082 will register to the eureka server
==> server has all infos now port,ip addresses
if customer want to talk to fraud, he will send a discovery request to eureka server to ask him where the ffraud service lives?
==> server will respond with one of the instances
Customer talks to appropriate service fraud
